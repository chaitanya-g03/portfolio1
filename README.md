## 📑 Components Explained

### 🔹 HTML (`index.html`)
The HTML file includes the structure of the website, divided into multiple semantic sections:
- `header`: Navigation bar and my name.
- `section.about`: Introduction and career goals.
- `section.skills`: Lists technical (Python, SQL, Excel, etc.) and soft skills.
- `section.projects`: Highlights major projects with tools used.
- `section.education`: Academic background including CGPA.
- `section.certifications`: Courses and certificates like IBM Web Development.
- `section.contact`: Contact information.

### 🔹 CSS (`style.css`)
Defines the website's visual appearance and responsiveness:
- Flexbox/grid layouts for alignment.
- Media queries for responsive design.
- Color schemes for a clean, professional look.
- Button hover and transition effects for user engagement.

### 🔹 JavaScript (`script.js`) *(Optional or Minimal)*
- Adds dynamic behavior if used (e.g., smooth scrolling, animations).
- May include form validation or interactive project previews.

## 🚀 Key Features

- ✅ Mobile responsive
- ✅ Simple UI/UX
- ✅ Optimized for performance

## 🧠 My Git Journey: Concepts & Learnings

### ✅ Git Commands I Used
- `git init`: Initialize local repository.
- `git add .`: Stage all files for commit.
- `git commit -m "message"`: Save snapshots of progress.
- `git branch`, `git checkout`: Basic version control workflows.
- `git push origin main`: Deploy to GitHub repository.
- `git status`, `git log`: Check changes and history.

### 📘 What I Learned
- **Version Control Discipline**: Tracking changes keeps my codebase clean and recoverable.
- **GitHub Collaboration**: Understanding branches and merges prepares me for team workflows.
- **Project Management**: Writing meaningful commits and structuring code improves collaboration.
- **Deployment**: Learned how to host static websites via GitHub Pages.
